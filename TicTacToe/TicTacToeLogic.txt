Logic for Game

/*
Need 3 Arrays or one 2D array 
Swap input between player 1 and player 2 - Lock Player 1 input to x and player 2 input to o
Check if location of placed input == 0 if yes let player place an x or a O if no ask player to choose a different location
Check if board is full if full check for horizonatal diagonal and vertical x or o 
After third turn of  player 1 turn keep checking board for horizonatal diagonal and vertical x or o

    variable for player input // figure out input
    counter for player turns
    draw table for visual representation
